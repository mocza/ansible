# prox1 host's sanoid.conf -- backup destination for prox host snapshots
# Purpose: prox1 receives replicated snapshots from prox via syncoid
# This file can be minimal or empty since prox1 is primarily a backup destination
# If prox1 has its own datasets to snapshot, add them here

# Note: syncoid replication is handled by a separate systemd service
# This sanoid.conf is for prox1's own snapshots (if any)
